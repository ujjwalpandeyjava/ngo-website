				Voice of Slum has been dedicated to serving slum children since its establishment in 2016.
			</div>
			<p>
				<b>Voice of Slum</b> was established in 2016 by <i><b>Chandni Di</b></i> and <i><b>Dev Pratap</b></i>,
				who themselves grew up in a slum.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having endured the struggles of slum life firsthand, they were determined to spare other children from
				similar hardships and provide them with the childhood every child deserves.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>
					Thus, Voice of Slum was born from their desire to make a difference.
				</b>

				Their personal experiences served as the driving force behind the organizationâ€™s mission. From its
				humble beginnings in a small hut in the slum, Voice of Slum has grown to empower hundreds of children in
				the slums of Noida today.
